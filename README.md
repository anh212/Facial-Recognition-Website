## Facial Recognition Website (Front-end)
Simple website that detects faces from user submitted images using a facial recognition API<br>
Uses PostgreSQL database to store user info

## What I Learned
Learned both front-end and back-end technologies<br>
React.js/Redux<br>
Javascript/Node.js

## Usage
Requires Node.js and npm to be installed

`npm install`

Installs required packages<br>

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- Also need back-end components and PostgreSQL database to get the website fully functional
